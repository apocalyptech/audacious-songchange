You probably don't want to be using this.  This is a "tracking" plugin I adapted
from some old XMMS plugin, because I had wanted something which would
sort of mimic the way last.fm/audioscrobbler keeps track of its music.  Some of
this might have actually come from an early audioscrobbler plugin, now that I
think about it.

Specifically, I wanted something which would trigger at either a set time or
set percentage of the song (whichever came first), with a minimum song length,
and execute an arbitrary command at that time.

So, it certainly does that, but the code is truly horrible.  This thing started
out as a hack, years ago, and since that time pretty much the only changes have
been to make sure that the thing will at least compile versus the latest version
of whatever media player I've been using at the time (I seem to think that it
started out XMMS, briefly detoured into BMP, and now rests in Auadacious).

Anyway, don't expect anything out of it; this is just online at github so that
I've got it backed up elsewhere, honestly.  Someday it might be nice to write
up a plugin whose contents DON'T cause me to cringe, but it does seem pretty
unlikely that I'll ever get around to doing so.

Currently it works for me when compiled against Audacious 3.4.1, as provided by
Fedora 19.
