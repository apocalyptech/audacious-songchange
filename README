You probably don't want to be using this.  This is a "tracking" plugin I adapted
from some old XMMS plugin, because I had wanted something which would
sort of mimic the way last.fm/audioscrobbler keeps track of its music.  Some of
this might have actually come from an early audioscrobbler plugin, now that I
think about it.

Specifically, I wanted something which would trigger at either a set time or
set percentage of the song (whichever came first), with a minimum song length,
and execute an arbitrary command at that time.

So, it certainly does that, but the code is truly horrible.  This thing started
out as a hack, years ago, and since that time pretty much the only changes have
been to make sure that the thing will at least compile versus the latest version
of whatever media player I've been using at the time (I seem to think that it
started out XMMS, briefly detoured into BMP, and now rests in Auadacious).

Anyway, don't expect anything out of it; this is just online at github so that
I've got it backed up elsewhere, honestly.  Someday it might be nice to write
up a plugin whose contents DON'T cause me to cringe, but it does seem pretty
unlikely that I'll ever get around to doing so.

Currently it works for me when compiled against Audacious 3.9, as provided by
Arch Linux as of 2017.10.04.

   WARNING   
**************

The actual GUI configuration bit was disabled long ago 'cause I didn't feel
like keeping up with GTK+ changes.  To configure, make sure Audacious is
shut down and edit ~/.config/audacious/config and edit/add the following
stanza:

    [xmms_tracking]
    cmd_line=/home/user/bin/foo.pl -a "%a" -t "%t" -n "%n" -s "%s" -l "%l"
    minimum_len=0
    percent_done=45
    seconds_past=240

Percent strings available for formatting:

    %f - Full path to the file
    %a - Artist
    %t - Title
    %l - Album Name
    %y - Year
    %g - Genre
    %n - Track Number
    %s - Track length (in seconds)

Make sure to use double-quotes around any percent string - the plugin will
make sure that any quotes in the relevant tags are escaped properly.

TODO:
 * Reintroduce configuration UI
 * Fix memory leaks, etc
 * Make sure we don't try to get tag information for remote URLs
 * Should actually make it so quoting percent strings isn't required.
   Should just put 'em in automatically, probably.
